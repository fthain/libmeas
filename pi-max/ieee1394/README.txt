This is the old firewire stack for new linux kernels
====================================================
* Why should you want this?
You may have some hardware and software (like audio recording software) that wants
the old firewire stack.

* What do you need to compile this?
make, gcc, kernel headers.

* How do you build and install this?
- compile:
make modules
- install: 
sudo make modules_install
- load the modules:
sudo make modprobe
- chown the resulting /dev file so that you can access it
sudo make chown
- now see that ffado-diag works...
just run it and see that it prints that you have the modules, that the modules are loaded,
that the /dev/raw1394 is there and that it can be accessed.
- you can now go on to see if can work with the hardware that is attached to the firewire bus.

* On which kernels should this work on?
You only need it for 2.6.37 and later kernels since it was only in the 37 cycle that
the old stack was removed. At the time of writing this it means that it is only applicable
for kernels 2.6.37 and 2.6.38. I see no reason that this code should not work for future
kernels (meaning for 2.6.39 and later kernels). In any case if you do find that this does
not compile the errors will, in most probability, be minor. You can either fix them yourself
(if you know a little bit about kernel programming) or drop me a line. If you do fix
it yourself I would appreciate a patch to apply...
I run this on ubuntu systems (10.xx, 11.04).

* Who maintains this?
Currently just me (Mark Veltzer <mark.veltzer@gmail.com>).

* What is the output of all of this?
Three kernel modules which are installed in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra
and are called ieee1394.ko ohci1394.ko and raw1394.ko.
You only need to load ohci1394.ko and raw1394.ko since they both depend on ieee1394.ko and will
trigger it's loading. For most application raw1394.ko will suffice.

* To which kernel am I compiling the modules if I follow the instructions above?
To the kernel you are running on, the version of which you can find out using 'uname -r'

* What if I want to run on one kernel and compile to another?
Run the make commands above with KVER=[the version of the kernel you want the modules for].
For example:
mark@cantor:~/ieee1394$ make KVER=2.6.38.1-generic
OR
Edit the file 'Makefile', find the line that says 'KVER?=$(shell uname -r)'
and change it. For the same kernel as before it would become:
KVER?=2.6.38.1-generic
In this case no command line KVER is needed and it is actually counter productive
since it will override the version you put into the Makefile.

* How do I make this happen automatically on boot ?
- black list the new firewire stack
	edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-firewire.conf and turn it into:
	=================================
	# Select the legacy firewire stack over the new CONFIG_FIREWIRE one.

	#blacklist ohci1394
	#blacklist sbp2
	#blacklist dv1394
	#blacklist raw1394
	#blacklist video1394

	blacklist firewire-ohci
	blacklist firewire-sbp2
	=================================
- now rebuild the default collection of modules to be loaded on boot (initrd type systems
	like ubuntu).
	mark@cantor:~/links/ieee1394$ sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
- make the new stack load automatically on boot
	TBD
- control the permission on the /dev/raw1394 file using udev
	change /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permissions.rules (in my case I had to create it) to include:
	=================================
	# IEEE1394 (firewire) devices
	# Please note that raw1394 gives unrestricted, raw access to every single
	# device on the bus and those devices may do anything as root on your system.
	# Yes, I know it also happens to be the only way to rewind your video camera,
	# but it's not going to be group "video", okay?
	KERNEL=="raw1394", GROUP="audio"
	=================================
	now restart udev to read the definitions
	mark@cantor:~/links/ieee1394$ sudo restart udev
- configure jack correctly
	first configure jack properly via qjackctl. Configure it until you see that
	it runs properly. Pay attention to these parameters:
	- driver to use: firewire
	- sample rate: something that your hardware supports (mine could only
	do 48000).
	- periods/buffer: mine could only do 2.
	- audio: should be in duplex for most cards.
	- interface: choose the right one if you have multiple cards.
- run jack on login automatically
	In ubuntu you can go to "System->Preferences->Startup Applications" and
	add a new application that will run "source ~/.jackdrc".

* Why did you do this?
Well - I saw a post on a patch for the old stack at
https://sicnarf.com/2011/running-the-old-firewire-stack-on-linux-2-6-38-rc3/ and after reviewing the patch
it occured to me that the patch is quite non intrusive and could easily be made into a standalone piece of
software which will ease it's use for many people since it will not require a kernel recompile (which a lot
of people are not that adapt at and which is turning a little bit harder with each passing day).
Half an hour later I had the patch ready with minimal edits to the code.
