1. This is how to install the driver. Note this requires the old firewire raw1394 driver!
This is not supported anymore....

modprobe pipci
modprobe raw1394
mknod /dev/rspipci0 c 177 0

2. This is a sample output from dmesg when the driver was loaded:

pipci: module license 'Proprietary' taints kernel.
