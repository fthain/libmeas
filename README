2. Compling libmeas
-------------------

2.1 Install required external libraries (Fedora naming convention): 
   plplot-devel, grace-devel, libusb-devel
   For pi-max, you will need the freely available pvcam library installed in
   /usr/lib and /usr/include. Also, you will need to install the
   libraw1394-devel package. Don't forget to install the necessary kernel
   level driver for the camera. Last time I checked, these drivers were not
   compatible with the latest kernels but they can be fairly easily patched
   to work with the 2.6.x series. Also they need the old firewire stack.
   For gpib, you will need the linux gpib package 
   (http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/). Be sure to install and activate the
   kernel modules. Install under /usr (i.e. ./configure --prefix=/usr)

2.2. Compile by issuing make

2.3. Install (as root) with make install

2.4. For documentation look at the source files under libmeas and examples.

2.6. To link program agaist this library use: -lmeas -lm -lpvcam -lraw1394 -ldl -lforms -lX11 -lgpib -lusb -lrt

If pvcam interface is not compiled, drop -lpvcam and -lraw1394 from above.
Note that many functions require root access. While I have tried to pay
attention to security issues, this has not been my top priority. So remember
this when you make programs linked against this library setuid root (i.e.,
chmod u+s). There are functions in misc.c to switch between normal user
and root (given the setuid bit).

3. Documentation
----------------

Read the source ;-) This is the easiest approach as I have included 
comments there. Look also at the example applications under examples directory.
