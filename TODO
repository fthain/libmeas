- complete SR810 lock in amplifier (needed for endor)
- we should have both rs232 and gpib interfaces available for devices that support this,
  so that they could be used in systems without GPIB and vice versa. speficy in open statement and store info
  in the device structure.
- we should have documentation (in LaTeX)
- we should probably use pkg-config rather than have the makefile options in
  /usr/include/meas/make.conf
- Since wayland is coming, we need to ditch X11 stuff in src/graphics.c
  SDL seems like the best option for this as it already supports wayland.
