- complete SR810 lock in amplifier (needed for endor)
- wavelength calibration params should be variables, not preproc defines.
- instead of hard coding termination for gpib devices, add a function to 
  deal with this.
- we should have both rs232 and gpib interfaces available for devices that support this,
  so that they could be used in systems without GPIB and vice versa.
- we should have documentation (in LaTeX)
- we should probably use pkg-config rather than have the makefile options in
  /usr/include/meas/make.conf
- be consistent: some have init() and some open() as the function name to get things going.
